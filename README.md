# Introduction

This tutorial is meant for those who want to get to know the *Flow* of TensorFlow. Ideally, you already know some of the *Tensor* of TensorFlow. That is, in this tutorial we aren’t going to go deep into any of the linear algebra, calculus, and statistics which are used in machine learning.

# Application

To ground this tutorial in some real-world application, we decided to use a common beginner problem from Natural Language Processing (NLP): **email classification**. The idea is simple - given an email you’ve never seen before, determine whether or not that email is Spam or not (aka Ham).
